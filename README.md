WHY just WHY...

I have worked in these games so I have a developer distribution licence so you guys get the beta they get testers we all are happy
(YAY)


games so far...

developed by he1ios (ME)

1. Stranded deep ( partnership with the beamteam)

2. Terraria (Patnership with relogic)

3. Insanelunky (ONLY ME @ he1ios.github.io/insanelunky)

4. Spelunky (Graphics Design) @he1ios.github.io/insanelunky also)

5. Subnautica below 0 (Bug exploit)

6. Among trees (One of the devs for game)

For problems:

  go to he1ios.github.io/insanelunky and click download then download dxwebsetup.exe from the releases and run it
  
  For people who think dxwebsetup is a scam it's by microsoft so if you d'ont trust me go to microsoft.com and search dxwebsetup by microsoft
  
  OR run the .exe file and see it's by microsoft
  
  FOR mac use wineskin at https://github.com/He1ios/MYGAMES/releases to run .exe in the releases page
  
  IF they all don't work message me at artemisfowl178@gmail.com

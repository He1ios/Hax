I have created a new minecraft launcher minecraft_launcher X 

Why is it special...

It can run multiple versions at once and multiple version of forge and other modpacks also

What else...

you can connect your minecraft id or just play without and still be able to connect to all minecraft servers

Also you can run this launcher on a usb

This is in the folders


MAC and linux are the same but for windows go with all OS's
